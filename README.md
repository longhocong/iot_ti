SMART HOME (IOT)

Description: The project aims to control devices within a home, such as fans and lights, using WiFi and enable remote control of these devices through a web server. The system utilizes an ESP8266 module for WiFi connectivity, a TIVA TM4C123PM Kit, and various sensors including light and temperature sensors. The ESP8266 acts as a central server, facilitating communication between users and the MCU controller. The project involves research on web development, user interfaces, web servers, UART communication, Ajax technology, and real-time operating systems like FreeRTOS.

Components:

ESP8266 module for WiFi connectivity
TIVA TM4C123PM Kit for MCU control
Light and temperature sensors
Web server for remote control and monitoring
Ajax technology for efficient data exchange
FreeRTOS real-time operating system for task scheduling
